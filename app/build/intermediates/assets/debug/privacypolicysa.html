<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'><br>
These Terms of Service (“Terms“) govern your access to and use of SuperApp
(“SuperApp”, “we”, “us” or “our”) mobile applications (the “Service”). The
Service is made available via SuperApp’s proprietary software that provides for
single log-in centralized platforms that enable you to manage and publish
social media content to multiple supported platforms, including Twitter,
Facebook, and other social networking sites. Your access to and use of the
Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the
Service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'><br>
By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”),
then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you
represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to
these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to you and that
Organization.<br>
You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with SuperApp,
and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state,
national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The Service may change
from time to time as we evolve, refine or add more features to the Service,
often without prior notice to you. In addition, SuperApp may temporarily or
permanently stop providing the Service, or any features within the Service, to
you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.</span></p>

<b>Third-Party Products and Services</b></span></p>

You acknowledge that the Service may enable or assist you to access, interact
with, and/or purchase services from several supported platforms and other third
parties via third-party websites or applications (collectively, the
“Third-Party Services”). If at any time any Third-Party Services cease to make
their programs available to SuperApp on reasonable terms, SuperApp may cease to
provide such features to you without entitling you to refund, credit, or other
compensation.<br>
When you access the Third-Party Services, you will do so at your own risk. Any
use of Third-Party Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions of
such Third-Party Services (and you shall comply with all such terms and
conditions), and any contract entered into, or any transaction completed via
any Third-Party Services, is between you and the relevant third party, and not
SuperApp. SuperApp makes no representation and shall have no liability or
obligation whatsoever in relation to the content or use of, or correspondence
with, any such Third-Party Services or any transactions completed and any
contract entered into by you with any such third party.</span></p>
